It was the first actual complex program that I made. It took a lot of time, and some parts were very hard to solve or think. However, it was a great chance for me to challeng
my self and expand my thoughts. I also was able to learn lots of functions such as system, Sleep, fstream...etc. Even if the process was kind of making my head sick, I
really like the process. I will build another project soon.
